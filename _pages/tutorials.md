#Echo State Networks
A tutorial with up to date self-containted implementation of echo state networks can be found [here](https://github.com/aracca994/Echo-State-Networks).

Echo State Networks (ESN) are a type of recurrent neural network, whose training consists in solving a linear system and does not require gradient descent [1].ESNs have been shown to perform with similar accuracy to other reccurrent neural networks, such as LSTMs and GRUs. Training ESNs is straightforward, but their performance is highly sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters.
